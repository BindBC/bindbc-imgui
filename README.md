# BindBC-ImGui
D binding to CImgui with additional OpenGL and SDL backends

# Adding to your project
To add bindbc-imgui to your project run
```
dub add bindbc-imgui
```
bindbc-imgui will currently build it's own dependencies. We've found that distributing deps for all possible targets too onerous, and so instead now depend on an existing toolchain and tools. That said, we're open to contributions for doing this in a more traditional way across platforms, but we're experiementing with this to make development of inochi-creator (and it's related projects) easier. 

## Availible Configs
These configs have been developed to ease the use of this project in inochi-creator. Happy to accept PRs for additional configs with alternate goals. But we'd like to avoid (if this works how we're hoping) attempting to distribute binaries within our git source going forward.

### static_dynamicCRT
Statically linked cimgui, dynamically linked C/C++ runtime libraries.
### static_staticCRT
Statically linked cimgui, statically linked C/C++ runtime libraries.

## Platform Dependencies
### Windows
#### Dependencies
- Visual Studio 2022 (With "Desktop development with C++" workflow installed)
  - In theory, "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022" should also work, but is untested.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (Currently 3.16 or higher is needed.)
- Dlang, either dmd or ldc

### Linux
#### Dependencies
- The equivalent of build-essential on Ubuntu, on centos 7, this was `sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'`, this should get you a working C++ toolchain.
- Dlang, either dmd or ldc
- CMake (Currently 3.16 or higher is needed.)
- SDL2 (developer package)
- Freetype (developer package)
- appimagetool (for building an AppImage)

### Mac
#### Notes
- Currently only the dynamic version of the library works on macOS, you will additionally need `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11` to avoid pointer alignment linking errors on macOS (for now)
- Only LDC2 is supported.
#### Dependencies
- You will need [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/) installed to build this project.
  - You will additionally need to set it up for command line use, see `Tools->How to Install For Command Line Use` in the CMake GUI

# Using backends
To select backends use the `versions` directive in your dub package file
Current backends are: `USE_GL`, `USE_SDL2` (depends on bindbc-sdl) and `USE_GLFW` (depends on bindbc-glfw).

# Running examples
To run the examples go in to the `examples` directory and compile the example in question.
